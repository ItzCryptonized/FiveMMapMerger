# FiveM  Map Merger
Place all your map files in the folder and it will go through and merge them all into one folder! 

### Folder Layout:
- Main Folder - Stream Folder
- Stream Folder - All your map files

 ### Installation Instructions:
 1. Ensure you have Node.JS installed on your machine
 2. Insert all your map folders into the *maps* folder, ensure they are in their own folder for each map, with a stream folder.
3. Run the BAT file and if it says Finished then it should be done
4. You can take your map files out the merged folder.

Please note, all this script does it takes every file in each of the streams folder and moves them into a merged folder, with a premade fxmanifest lua. Some map files may not work!\
``This may not work with the maps have _manifest.yml's as they have different resource luas. You are welcome to edit it if you know what you are doing.``\
If there are any bugs / issues please let me know so I can work on fixing them, or if you know what you're doing, feel free to do them yourself and create a pull request to share with everyone else!
